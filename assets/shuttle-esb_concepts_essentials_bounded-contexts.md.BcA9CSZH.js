Have a look at <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">how Martin Fowler defines this</a>. In that definition he also refers to what he calls <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MultipleCanonicalModels.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">multiple canonical models</a>.</p><p>To make the concept of a bounded context more clear we could take seats in a stadium as an example. A stadium contains seats but a seat represents different things to different people.</p><h2 id="financial-management" tabindex="-1">Financial Management <a class="header-anchor" href="#financial-management" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Financial Management&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In most scenarios one would have to keep an asset register and it is typically owned by the financial folks since they are the <em>system of record</em> for any assets.</p><p>The finance department would be interested in <strong>data</strong> such as:</p><ul><li>asset number</li><li>asset type</li><li>date of purchase</li><li>cost</li><li>method of depreciation</li><li>date commissioned</li><li>date decommissioned</li></ul><p>They would also be interested in the following <strong>behaviour</strong>:</p><ul><li>Commission()</li><li>Depreciate()</li><li>Decommission()</li></ul><h2 id="maintenance-management" tabindex="-1">Maintenance Management <a class="header-anchor" href="#maintenance-management" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Maintenance Management&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The maintenance department would be interested in <strong>data</strong> such as:</p><ul><li>maintenance required</li><li>maintenance schedules</li></ul><p>The <strong>behaviour</strong> for them would be along the lines of:</p><ul><li>ScheduleMaintenance()</li><li>RegisterMaintenanceSchedule()</li></ul><h2 id="event-management" tabindex="-1">Event Management <a class="header-anchor" href="#event-management" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Event Management&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The event booking folks would be have <strong>data</strong> like this:</p><ul><li>event name</li><li>event date</li><li>relevant seat number(s)</li></ul><p>And the relevant <strong>behaviour</strong> would include:</p><ul><li>RegisterEvent()</li><li>SellTicket()</li></ul><h2 id="putting-it-all-together" tabindex="-1">Putting it all together <a class="header-anchor" href="#putting-it-all-together" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Putting it all together&quot;">​</a></h2><p>So, as we can see, even though a physical seat is one thing it can mean very different things to different people. This is where a <em>Bounded Context</em> comes in. You may even find that a similar concept is called something else in each context. You may find that an <code>Employee</code> in the <em>HR</em> BC is called a <code>User</code> in the <em>Identity &amp; Access Control</em> BC, or an <code>Author</code> in the <em>Collaboration</em> BC.</p><p>As behaviour is invoked on various objects within each BC the other BCs may need to be informed. To accomplish this one would need some communication mechanism based on an <em>Event Driven Architecture</em>. That is, of course, where a service bus like Shuttle.Esb would come in handy.</p><p>The <em>Financial Management</em> BC could publish an <code>AssetRegistered</code> and the other BCs would subscribe to that event and then determine if they need to register the asset number as an item they are interested in.</p><p>When the <em>Maintenance Management</em> BC removes a seat for maintenance it would publish a <code>ItemRemovedForMaintenance</code> that the <em>Booking Management</em> BC would subscribe to in order to exclude the seat as a bookable item for any events until the item is made available again.</p><h2 id="canonical-models" tabindex="-1">Canonical Models <a class="header-anchor" href="#canonical-models" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Canonical Models&quot;">​</a></h2><p>All this is quite different and contrasting to what many enterprise-level architects refer to as a canonical data model. Stefan Tilkov has <a href="https://www.innoq.com/en/blog/thoughts-on-a-canonical-data-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">something to say</a> about these too.</p><p>For our scenario a canonical model would need to include all the data from the various BCs. This is quite cumbersome and really does not add any real value.</p>',27),l=[o];function s(r,d,c,h,m,u){return t(),a("div",null,l)}const b=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,b as default};
